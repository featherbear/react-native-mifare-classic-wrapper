# React Native Mifare Classic Wrapper

[react-native-nfc-manager]: https://github.com/whitedogg13/react-native-nfc-manager/tree/aecd7fd689daedae2039256dda2a23c7e6cd2467
[Expo]: https://expo.io/

This library is a wrapper over [react-native-nfc-manager] (v2.1.9), providing streamlined functionality for Mifare Classic commands. It uses the V1 API and performs working function flows that are incorrect in the the [documentation](https://github.com/whitedogg13/react-native-nfc-manager/blob/aecd7fd689daedae2039256dda2a23c7e6cd2467/APIv1.md).

## Compatibility / Requirements

* You will need a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project of _version 0.60_ or greater
* **ANDROID ONLY** - No support for iOS is given
  * Whilst iOS device can read Mifare Classic cards, it does not support reading non-NDEF payloads. 

_If you are using the [Expo] framework, you will need to [eject](https://docs.expo.io/expokit/eject/) your application in order to use this, as NFC is not supported by [Expo]. ... alternatively, [these instructions](https://codersera.com/blog/running-expo-react-native-together/) may work for you._
